    /*!
     * \details In the 0.4.0 XplnObj library was fixed manipulator logic 
     *          and added new manipulator 'panel'. This method checks 
     *          each INode in the scene and if it has cockpit attribute 
     *          the method applies the panel manipulator to the INode.
     *          This behavior is needed for the backward compatibility.
     *          
     *          It should not break the scene but it is good if the user
     *          manually checks each cockpit object to make sure all 
     *          things are correct with the manipulators after this method
     *          and disables manipulators if they are not needed.
     *          
     *          Although it should not break the scene the behavior
     *          can be changed it is not possible to avoid this situation
     *          because the previous behavior was based on the bug 
     *          and had undefined logic behavior in some cases, 
     *          it is too difficult to recognize and fix it programmatically.
